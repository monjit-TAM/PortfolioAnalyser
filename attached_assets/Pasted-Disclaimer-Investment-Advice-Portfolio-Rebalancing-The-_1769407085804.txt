Disclaimer – Investment Advice & Portfolio Rebalancing

The investment advice, recommendations, and portfolio rebalancing suggestions displayed on thealphalens.com are algorithmic outputs generated by proprietary Growth and Value investing models. These models are based on widely accepted investment frameworks, including Value Investing principles popularised by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett and Growth Investing methodologies, using quantitative financial, price, and momentum data.

The recommendations are derived from a rule-based scoring system that evaluates stocks across multiple parameters such as valuation metrics, growth indicators, financial ratios, price performance, and market positioning. Final BUY, HOLD, or SELL signals are generated through a combined scoring logic that blends Value and Growth perspectives.
These outputs are not the result of any individual analyst’s, advisor’s, or portfolio manager’s judgment.

The advice and rebalancing suggestions are purely model-driven, informational, and educational in nature.
