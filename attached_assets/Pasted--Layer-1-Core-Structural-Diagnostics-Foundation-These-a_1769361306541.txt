🧠 Layer 1: Core Structural Diagnostics (Foundation)
These are non-negotiable.
📊 1. Allocation Breakdown
Market cap: Large / Mid / Small
Sector allocation
Industry concentration
Domestic vs International (if applicable)
Equity vs Debt vs Cash
Thematic clustering (PSU-heavy, Tech-heavy etc.)
🎯 2. Style Analysis
Value vs Growth tilt
Momentum exposure
Quality factor exposure
Low-vol vs High-beta tilt
This becomes your “Value/Growth engine” USP.
📉 Layer 2: Risk Intelligence (This is where you differentiate)
Most Indian tools are shallow here.
⚠️ 3. Concentration Risk
Top 3 / Top 5 exposure %
Single sector overexposure flag
Single stock > X% threshold indicator
📉 4. Volatility & Drawdown Metrics
Historical volatility
Max drawdown
Downside deviation
Beta vs benchmark
Sortino ratio (retail-friendly explanation)
Not just numbers — visual representation.
📊 Layer 3: Behavioural Signals (This will be your killer feature)
This is where you stand apart.
🧠 5. Behaviour Score
Overtrading detection
Average holding period
High churn behaviour
Panic sell history (if available via broker data)
You can label it as:
“Portfolio Behaviour Pattern”
Not:
“You are emotional.”
📈 Layer 4: Benchmark & Opportunity Intelligence
Still analytical, not advisory.
📍 6. Drift Analysis
How far portfolio deviates from:
Nifty 50
Sensex
Model Portfolio (broker-defined)
Call it:
Alignment Score
Not:
Rebalance recommendation.
📊 7. Overlap Detection
Duplicate exposure across:
Multiple stocks in same business
Same sector theme
Example:
6 different PSU exposure positions
💰 Layer 5: Return Attribution
This is rare in retail tools.
📌 8. Return Contribution Analysis
Which stock contributed most to gains
Which stock dragged returns
Sector contribution breakdown
Style contribution breakdown
It educates without advising.
🔬 Layer 6: Hidden Risk Radar (Advanced, Powerful)
🔎 9. Liquidity Risk Indicator
Avg traded value vs position size
Days to liquidate metric
Given your liquidity post earlier — this will resonate.
💣 10. Tail Risk Exposure
% portfolio in high-volatility stocks
% in ASM/GSM stocks
Small cap risk exposure score
No “sell.” Just “risk classification.”
🌍 Layer 7: Macro Sensitivity Layer
Very powerful for brokers.
🌐 11. Interest Rate Sensitivity
Banking-heavy portfolio flag
Duration risk for debt allocation
🛢 12. Commodity Exposure Mapping
Crude-sensitive companies
INR-sensitive exposure
This makes you institutional.
📊 Layer 8: Portfolio Health Score (The Visual Hook)
Create a composite score:
Diversification Score
Risk Score
Style Balance Score
Liquidity Score
Call it:
AlphaMarket Portfolio Health Index
This becomes shareable.
🔥 Layer 9: Scenario Engine (Big Differentiator)
Without advising, you can simulate:
“If Nifty falls 10%”
“If Midcaps correct 20%”
“If Banking drops 15%”
Show projected impact.
Not advice. Just stress testing.
🚀 Layer 10: AI Narrative Summary (Huge UX Win)
At the end of report:
“Your portfolio shows a strong mid-cap growth tilt with moderate sector concentration and elevated volatility compared to Nifty 50…”
Educational. Clean. Non-prescriptive.
This makes brokers look smart.
